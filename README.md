# Efficient zk-Rollup Implementation in Rust - project 4
**Abstract**: This project provides an opportunity for students to dig deep into the world of blockchain by
constructing a zero-knowledge rollup, commonly referred to as zk-rollup [1]. Utilizing the Rust
programming language [2], students will work on implementing an efficient zk-rollup system that provides
minimal functionality of such a system. As a part of this project, students will develop the relevant
Ethereum smart contracts using Solidity to ensure the proper functioning of the zk-rollup system.
Alternatively, a Rust-based blockchain implementation is available for integration with the rollup, which
can be accessed in [3]. Additionally, a tutorial detailing the functioning of zk-rollup is provided in [4]. The
studentsâ€™ implementation at the very least should mirror the functionality outlined in the provided tutorial.
Finally, students are expected to document and demonstrate the functionalities of their implemented
system.

Implementation: **High**

Documentation: **Medium**
